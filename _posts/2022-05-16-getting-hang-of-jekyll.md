Hello, this is Diplo from the past. Today is 16/05/2022, you are seeing my very first blogpost on my own site. I am not a huge fan of web development as a domain so far(*I hope it doesn't stay the same in the future*) but again it's important to have a part of yourself on the internet. Not that the big tech isn't harvesting your likeliness enough, but you get the point. What better way to make this happen than having your own website.

<!--more-->

After failing multiple times picking up the reins of HTML/CSS/Javascript, the question of building a site from scratch was off. I do have niche experience of working with front-end before, like that one time I took my shot on a free course on FreeCodeCamp.org and gave up pretty soon after. Getting back, during a recent club meet someone brought up Jekyll, a tool to generate static sites out of thin air.

Jekyll is quite powerful indeed I was blown away by the easy at which it works, so I got the gem package and it was my time to shine. Finding a theme for the site was fairly easier, thank you Mr. Qi Tian/Tian Qi. I cloned the repo in a moments time and started exploring various configurations Jekyll offers. The wiki that came along with the repo was of huge help.

Since this site is a Work in Progress, I have hosted it github pages for now, I plan on getting a Diplo.Domain of my own in the near future if things go well *hopefully*.I should probably checkout how docker environment and such run so I can get insights of Backend development when I eventually get my Domain. I also got around setting Disqus on the site was relatively easier and no-cost.

With a smirk hanging over my lips and with the thought of this not being my last post, I'll take my leave for now until next ti
