Diplo is back agin with updates from the past months, from recording a podcast to bottling an exam, and also got the first hand dissapointment of getting your application rejected. With all this spice to come, let's dive into this month's dashboard update

<!--more-->
Haven't really had a chance to fiddle around with the site since the last update, truth be told I have been lethargic to get behind the keyboard for productive reasons again. But hey just like everything else in this world , there's a silver lining to it. I have been quite busy, in fact I caught up with a few friends over the past weekend.

Moving onto more interesting updates, I finally managed to record my first radio show/podcast and have another recording lined up in few days, I really wish I could I post the recording here but our man hasn't uploaded it on Soundcloud yet!! Has been all dissapointments since then, kicking things with the "Joggers Ordeal" which has been very upsetting to say the least.

Second Internals went decent and I am really looking forward to studying Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning as electives next semester, two similar yet vastly different areas of study. Despite being passionate about AI/DL my motivation to opt these was, *I wanted nothing to do with web development* I really despise the field.

Moving on, application for a research internship went south. Truth be told, I was reall looking forward to it. I usually am a sucker for blockchain, this internship was one of them. I even applied to a hackathon hosted by a blockchain based firm, It was offline too! and I my application got denied again.

Tough luck, we take those and move on.

~~Also, hit bronze III on Garena hehe~~
