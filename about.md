# In Essence 

Hello, I'm Darshan or Darsh or Vdarsh or Diplo depending on who you ask. Im a *second year* undergrad student at REVA University, Bengaluru. As a Computer Science major, I enjoy working in the fields of Data Science, AI/ML, Computer Vision and blockchain technologies. I am also up for partaking in tech fests, hackathons and code jams. I for one am a staunch supporter and proponent of FOSS tech, and will try to include as many open source resources in my projects as I can.

If you ever had to sign up for an event and were feeling short on a member,then I am your guy, [just hit me up](https://linktr.ee/diplo2bytes).
The concept of decentralised world also interests me more, which led to me falling in love with blockchain and equally despising cryptocurrencies. Speaking of things that I'm not a huge fan of, web development is one thing that I'd like to HYDE on my resume *geddit?* , but hey GO JEKYLL!!

My other interests include quizzing and debating, have a degree of experience in both of them. I also love to write, heck I even wrote content for a budding esports and gaming site. Morever I also curate content for a college club. Have an article or two published in the school magazine, so yeah I think we agree that I can do a bit of writing.

I am also a huge fan of performing in general, be it podcasts, Radio shows or even Dumb Charades,be it extempore or Mad Ads, I'll whip up something on time and make it look more than presentable. My past wild rides made me love filmmaking and editing but wouldn't really call it one of my strong suits. I do have a history/Architectural documentry I made in 11th grade, three hours before deadline while overdosing on Caffeine to show for.

To sum it all up, most of my effort goes into coming up with puns and alliterations. Not to mention broken humour and dank wit. Also this is more of short squeeze 4fun blog/journal that doesn't take itself too seriously, in case you feel the contrary, feel free to email me.
